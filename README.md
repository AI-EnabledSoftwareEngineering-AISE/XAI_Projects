# XAI_Projects
We plan to collect some of best exiting projects related to X-AI and our project here:

- [**Ecco**](https://github.com/jalammar/ecco), is a python library for exploring and explaining Natural Language Processing models using interactive visualizations. Ecco provides multiple interfaces to aid the explanation and intuition of Transformer-based language models. Read: Interfaces for Explaining Transformer Language Models. Ecco runs inside Jupyter notebooks. It is built on top of pytorch and transformers.
- [**Xplique**](https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique)(pronounced É›ks.plik) is a Python toolkit dedicated to explainability, currently based on Tensorflow. The goal of this library is to gather the state of the art of Explainable AI to help you understand your complex neural network models. 
- [**Captum**](https://github.com/pytorch/captum) is a model interpretability and understanding library for PyTorch. Captum means comprehension in Latin and contains general purpose implementations of integrated gradients, saliency maps, smoothgrad, vargrad and others for PyTorch models. It has quick integration for models built with domain-specific libraries such as torchvision, torchtext, and others.
